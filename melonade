# This is Melonade, a set of simple development/debugging accessories for Tcl/Tk.
# The idea is that you would start a Wish/Tcl+Tk shell for use as an interactive scratchpad for development, and [source] melonade to provide some GUI tools for inspecting/introspecting parts of the Tcl environment, with the ability to set traces, manage procs, etc. as well.

source every.tcl
source variable-inspector.tcl
# TODO: command browser
# TODO: proc browser/inspector/editor/manager ([info procs][info args][info body])
# TODO: functions as well?  i.e. mathops
source widget-inspector.tcl
source channel-inspector.tcl
# TODO: X11 event viewer?
